3
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,970
Autumn in Atka Bay, Antarctica.

4
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,920
Just a few weeks ago, this was open sea.

5
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,410
Now, a new frozen landscape is forming.

6
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,830
This new world appears devoid of life.

7
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,040
Well, almost.

8
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,160
An emperor penguin.

9
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,580
And he is not alone.

10
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,310
Thousands of emperors are coming to this frozen bay.

11
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,250
They are here because the new ice

12
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,900
provides the safest place for them to breed.

13
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,150
The ice will last nine months,

14
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,510
before melting away next summer.

15
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,380
And they will need every day of those nine months

16
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,350
to raise the next generation of this great emperor dynasty.

17
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,890
But to do so,

18
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,930
they will have to survive the coming winter.

19
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,790
The coldest and the cruellest

20
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,910
on earth.

22
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,760
Emperors pair up anew every year...

23
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,780
And although winter is fast approaching,

24
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,630
the process of finding the perfect partner

25
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,360
cannot be hurried.

26
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,670
New couples perform a graceful ritual

27
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,380
that will cement their commitment to each other.

28
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,200
Moving together in synchrony

29
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,000
is the key to creating a powerful bond.

30
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,270
And this bond needs to be one of the strongest in nature...

31
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,520
Because the survival of every family here,

32
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,000
and therefore the survival of this dynasty,

33
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,620
depends upon it.

34
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,060
A penguin is beautifully designed for many things...

35
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,340
But mating is not one of them.

36
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,590
Unfortunately, not all the penguins

37
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,690
have been able to find the perfect partner.

38
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,830
And, with time fast running out,

39
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,160
this female forgoes the formalities.

40
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,080
But this couple has already bonded too tightly

41
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,120
to be split apart by an interloper.

42
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,520
Penguins unlucky in love

43
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,650
head back to spend the winter feeding at sea,

44
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,550
because there's no food out here on the ice.

45
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,700
The couples now face weeks of waiting

46
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,880
while their eggs develop.

47
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,440
But one pair appears to have got ahead of schedule.

48
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,720
A bulge on a penguin's belly

49
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,770
is normally the sign of a parent keeping an egg warm on its feet.

50
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,760
But she seems to be trying to keep

51
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,690
a snowball warm.

52
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,570
They appear to be getting in some practice for the real thing.

53
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,370
The days are becoming shorter and colder...

54
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,490
Until finally,

55
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:47,060
the sun sets for the last time for two months.

56
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,480
It won't rise again until the spring.

57
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,710
Now, they live in a twilight world,

58
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,450
under the bright Antarctic moon.

59
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,210
For this couple, the long wait for their egg is almost over.

60
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,600
The female senses it.

61
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,440
Her contractions have begun.

62
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,070
The next generation of emperors is on its way.

63
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,470
Producing an egg takes a huge amount of energy,

64
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,180
such that the females lose a quarter of their body weight.

65
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,880
She hasn't eaten for over a month

66
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,790
and needs to return to the ocean to feed.

67
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,710
She can't take her precious egg with her,

68
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,030
so she must pass it to her partner to care for.

69
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,340
He has a special brood pouch to keep it warm,

70
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,250
close to his skin.

71
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,670
If he doesn't get the egg off the ice quickly,

72
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,200
it will freeze.

73
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,360
Now, she is free to go.

74
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,270
But she does seem rather reluctant to leave.

75
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,970
He will now have sole responsibility for their egg

76
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,860
all through the long, harsh winter.

77
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,420
He won't see his partner again

78
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,360
until the egg has hatched.

79
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,660
Over the next few days, every female in the colony

80
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,790
hurries away on the same 15-mile march

81
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,990
to the sea.

82
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,040
A freezing wind blowing in from the heart of the continent

83
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,130
drives the temperature down.

84
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,980
To keep themselves and their eggs warm,

85
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,890
the males now perform one of the most spectacular

86
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,510
demonstrations of cooperation in nature.

87
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,100
One by one,

88
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,100
they lock themselves into a huddle...

89
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,060
Creating a giant incubator

90
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,250
made up of over 4,000 male penguins.

91
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:52,220
Each individual constantly tries to push into the best possible position

92
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,710
to keep himself and his egg warm.

93
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,780
As a result,

94
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,440
the entire huddle is forever on the move.

95
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,380
Storm force winds

96
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:46,000
now drive the temperature down to -60 Celsius.

97
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,880
For the emperors on the outside,

98
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,370
facing the wind,

99
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,290
the conditions become unbearable.

100
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,130
They have no choice but to break off

101
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,720
and try to get round to the sheltered side.

102
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,850
He must get back on his feet,

103
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,930
but without letting go of his egg.

104
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,060
If he fails, the embryo inside

105
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,590
will rapidly freeze and die.

106
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,120
Once they arrive on the sheltered side of the huddle,

107
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,120
they get some relief from the wind.

108
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,600
When a blizzard sets in here,

109
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,980
it rages for days on end.

110
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,310
Now, the casualties are revealed.

111
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,560
Battered, starving and exhausted,

112
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,950
there is still no relief for the survivors.

113
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,430
The storm has driven them nearly a mile

114
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,980
from the safest path of the ice.

115
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,940
It's a weary march back to where they started from.

116
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,890
Now, they re-form their huddle,

117
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,030
to be ready for the next storm...

118
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,170
..Which will come, inevitably.

119
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:15,020
Only after two months of brutal weather

120
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,840
does the polar night finally come to an end.

121
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,260
And with it comes a hint of warmth.

122
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,810
The return of the sun coincides

123
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,630
with the appearance of the newest members of the colony.

124
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,620
In a matter of days, there are thousands

125
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,150
of hungry mouths, all demanding food.

126
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,100
Their fathers haven't eaten anything for nearly four months.

127
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,660
Yet they have kept back a vital reserve,

128
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,330
a kind of thick penguin milk,

129
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,310
just for this moment.

130
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,650
But it's only enough to keep the chick alive for a few days.

131
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,750
The females must return soon with food.

132
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,760
For some, it's already too late.

133
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,590
The first of the females are returning.

134
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,750
Fat and well fed, more arrive,

135
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,930
all with food for the chicks.

136
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,660
And not a moment too soon for the waiting fathers.

137
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,070
A mother's first sight of her young chick.

138
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,700
With their bond reaffirmed,

139
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,910
the whole family celebrates.

140
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,410
Now at last, he can hand over

141
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,210
his precious chick to its mother.

142
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,380
But there are less fortunate females here,

143
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,560
whose chicks have died.

144
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,660
Yet their parenting instinct is still strong.

145
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,750
The sight of a youngster being handed over

146
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,960
is irresistible.

147
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,480
More chickless females join in the melee.

148
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,240
The chick appears to be safe...

149
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,980
But it is no longer with its true parents.

150
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,110
The prospects for a kidnapped chick are never good.

151
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,800
Despite their immense efforts over the last three months,

152
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,780
this couple have nothing to show for it.

153
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,520
For those couples that have been successful,

154
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,590
it's the father's turn to head back to sea

155
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,950
to get a much-needed meal for himself...

156
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,180
..And to take his turn collecting food for the chick.

157
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,940
The mother is now able to bond

158
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,610
with her new baby...

159
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,760
..And, urgently, to feed it.

160
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,840
Its first taste of sea food.

161
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:22,450
But the times of hardship are not over.

162
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,780
Another storm,

163
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,620
and another white-out.

164
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,760
For some, this is a catastrophe.

165
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,180
They have tumbled into a ravine in the ice...

166
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,750
..With steep, slippery walls.

167
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:16,000
Chicks are now a deadly burden.

168
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:21,290
Mothers carrying young cannot grip the ice.

169
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,390
If she doesn't get out,

170
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,450
they will both die.

171
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,790
This mother has had to make a terrible choice.

172
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,780
To save herself,

173
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,580
she has abandoned her chick.

174
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,280
One mother, at least, is not prepared to give up on her chick.

175
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,210
Mother and chick are safe.

176
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,600
There is, occasionally,

177
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,770
a respite from the brutality of Antarctica.

178
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,230
Clear skies, gentle winds...

179
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,360
..And a particularly spectacular display of the Southern Lights.

180
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,170
The Aurora Australis.

181
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,560
As the sun climbs higher every day,

182
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,070
it warms the ice.

183
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,600
Soon, the emperors' frozen world

184
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,000
will start to melt away.

185
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,130
For the last few weeks,

186
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,680
the mother and father have

187
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,250
taken it in turn to feed their offspring.

188
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,270
But its growing appetite will soon force both parents to go away

189
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,720
fishing at the same time.

190
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,310
Now it's time to encourage the month-old chicks

192
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,990
Sometimes, it takes a well-timed kick.

193
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,890
Now, both parents can head off to sea to go fishing.

194
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,640
For the first time,

195
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,400
the chicks will have to face the elements

196
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,530
without a parent to protect them.

197
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:53,150
Other adults certainly won't look after them.

198
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:03,200
So, lone chicks gather together for comfort.

199
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,320
As the temperature drops to -25,

200
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,070
the chicks instinctively create their own mini-huddle,

201
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,850
just as their fathers do.

202
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,820
This is no time

203
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,760
for a youngster to be alone.

204
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,110
If they're lucky,

205
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,790
some chicks may still have

206
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,800
the protection of a parent taking a break from fishing.

207
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,030
But for the majority,

208
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,200
the huddle is their only shelter.

209
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,440
Even in this weather, adults must still

210
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,110
head back and forth to the sea to bring back food.

211
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:18,340
The instinct to follow adults is still strong.

212
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,610
But in a blizzard,

213
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,940
that is a bad idea.

214
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,130
The adults' disappearance

215
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,580
leaves the chicks in confusion.

216
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,290
Lost and alone, his only hope

217
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:18,370
is that this adult is heading back to the colony,

218
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:22,540
and not away from it, across the frozen wastes.

219
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,410
With the last of the big storms over,

220
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:11,220
summer has arrived.

221
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:19,810
The ice that has been the penguins' home is melting.

222
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:32,400
These chicks are almost fully grown,

223
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,780
and approaching independence.

224
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,430
Before they leave for the sea, all emperors -

225
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,880
adults and their chicks, must moult.

226
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:21,170
For the youngsters, this marks the arrival of adulthood.

227
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,760
Against all the odds, two thirds have survived.

228
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:45,190
But the annual disappearance of their ice world

229
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:49,670
is a reminder that they face an uncertain future.

230
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:56,230
Ocean temperatures are expected to rise year-on-year.

231
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:02,740
This Antarctic sea ice on which all emperor penguins rely

232
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,480
may not freeze for long enough each year

233
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,160
for them to complete their extraordinary life cycle.

234
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:19,600
But, as the whole colony prepares to leave Atka Bay...

235
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,340
These parents have successfully raised

236
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:30,700
the next generation in this emperors' dynasty.

239
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,090
To capture the extraordinary story of the emperor penguins,

240
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:57,400
the Dynasties team had to travel to the end of the Earth.

241
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:02,470
Neumayer research station will be home to the film crew

242
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,460
for nearly a year.

243
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:09,150
There's about 70 tonnes worth of food.

244
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,110
We've got about 15 boxes of white cabbage.

246
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:16,910
Neumayer has everything they need.

247
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,330
But it's a different world outside.

248
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,780
It's really easy to feel quite comfortable inside, and...

249
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,790
This place, it's...

250
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,440
wild, really wild.

251
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,590
It's worth reminding ourselves of that every now and again.

252
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:36,250
Oh, I've got to go inside!

253
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,690
The crew need five layers of clothing before they can even

254
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,740
think of leaving the base.

255
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:49,080
As the final plane departs, they know that it'll be the last

256
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,400
till winter is over in eight months' time.

257
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:56,680
Now the plane's just left and that's us on our own, now.

259
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:01,410
Nobody will be coming in case something happened.

261
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,690
We are now all by ourselves.

262
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,190
When the team head out to explore,

263
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,920
they discover just how careful they'll have to be

264
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,670
working in this hostile world.

265
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,990
We've come across an enormous crack,

266
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:18,460
so we're probably on an unsafe piece of ice at the moment.

267
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,900
Oh, my God!

268
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:21,490
Did you just hear that?

269
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:26,610
A deep crack in the edge of the ice shelf like this

270
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,460
can be extremely dangerous.

271
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,280
Oh, my word, it just goes straight down.

272
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,140
This area's definitely not safe.

273
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,860
An incredible reminder of how...

274
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,030
how unpredictable this place is.

275
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,140
It's just mind-blowing.

276
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:47,670
Six miles from the station, the permanent ice meets the ocean.

277
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,760
This is where the penguins will soon be heading.

278
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:56,880
Once the sea is frozen, the team will have to cross

279
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,150
the treacherous, newly-formed ice to reach them.

280
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,560
I've found a decent spot for the,

281
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,550
uh, for the guys to lower me down

282
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,890
onto the sea ice for the first time.

283
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,590
So Will's going to act as a bit of a safety man for me,

284
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,230
in case anything goes wrong.

285
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,190
These are our first few steps onto the sea ice.

286
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,490
It definitely feels a bit nerve-racking,

287
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,630
knowing that there's a couple of hundred meters

288
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,670
of water underneath us.

289
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,890
To find a safe route, the crew must check the depth of the ice

290
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:33,210
all the way.

291
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:38,150
Ice around 30 centimetres and above is stable.

292
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,680
This is a great moment for us.

293
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,760
We finally made it to the colony.

294
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,400
Yeah, it's really special.

295
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,890
When it's this still and there's this many birds in front of you,

296
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,790
It makes the place look absolutely beautiful.

297
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,270
A few weeks later, the sun sets for the last time,

298
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:06,860
and Antarctica reveals its harsher side.

299
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:10,500
We think it's probably minus 50.

300
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,810
The sun is somewhere below the horizon.

301
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:15,770
It still won't be visible for another...

302
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:18,870
..Six weeks, probably.

303
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,890
so this is something that we're going to have to get used to.

304
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:26,230
It's easier said than done.

305
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,400
Oh, God!

306
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,290
And then, the storms come.

307
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,220
We've got proper, proper weather now,

308
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,900
and really, really strong winds.

309
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,190
The colony's just in front of us.

310
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,930
Sometimes, it disappears behind the snow.

311
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,200
It's been hovering around 100kph now, since it's picked up.

312
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:03,920
What these penguins are having to put up with out there,

313
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,310
it's just mind-blowing.

314
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,030
We're finally coming to the end of this storm.

315
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,110
There's all sorts of weird rattling sounds and...

316
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,800
To be quite honest, I don't know how this station

317
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,300
manages to stay standing.

318
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:33,370
Finally, the sun returns,

319
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,530
but the storms continue.

320
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,670
A break in the weather

321
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:41,550
reveals something the team had not expected.

322
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:44,180
But I can hear a heck of a lot of noise coming

323
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,200
from just over the brow.

324
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,640
Oh, man!

325
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,660
Oh, my word.

326
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,600
There are... There are birds down there with chicks.

327
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,060
Film crews have to capture events as they unfold,

328
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:02,840
whatever their feelings.

329
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:11,120
I know it's natural, but it's, um...

330
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,700
It's bloody hard to watch.

331
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,070
Oh, my word.

332
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,050
I think we're just going to have to observe them for a bit

333
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:28,250
and see exactly what's happening.

334
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,610
We've come back up onto the top

335
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:39,500
because the weather is coming in again

336
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,150
and we were just about to pack up,

337
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,280
and an adult with a chick on its feet managed to

338
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,970
make its way up.

339
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,050
It's amazing, it's using its beak,

340
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,340
and then when it got to this last little lip, erm,

341
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,950
its wings.

342
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,260
Oh, man, if only the other 50 in there

343
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,530
could do the same.

344
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,700
Hopefully the weather will clear again tomorrow

345
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,260
and we can get back down here,

346
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:07,380
and fingers crossed, there'll be a few less birds in this hole.

347
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,220
Two days later, the weather

348
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:13,070
allows the team to return to the colony.

349
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,320
Already, the gully has claimed more casualties.

350
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,490
The team decide to act.

351
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,740
We've given it a lot of thought.

352
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:25,110
We've decided that we are definitely going to dig a shallow ramp

353
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:26,890
that they will hopefully use.

354
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,120
It's very rare for the film crew to intervene.

355
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,150
But they realise that they may be able to save at least some

356
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:39,910
of these birds simply by digging a few steps in the ice.

357
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,330
Oh, man! Will, look.

358
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,380
Oh, my goodness.

359
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,360
We were literally just about to leave but

360
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,740
the first birds are definitely making their way out,

361
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,250
which is brilliant.

362
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,730
So, hopefully, they'll just make their way back to the colony

363
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:57,500
and them and their chicks will have a much better chance

364
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,910
of survival, because there's no chance that they were going

365
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:02,580
to survive down there at all.

366
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,060
The crew follow the chicks as they grow up.

367
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:11,250
And after months with the emperors,

368
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:15,900
their time in Antarctica is finally coming to a close.

369
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,330
We're coming to the end of the trip now, and, um...

370
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,430
Yeah, we've had a...

371
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:26,630
We've had an amazing year, and...

372
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,430
I'm obviously desperate to get home.

373
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,360
But there's, um...

374
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,800
There's an odd part of me that doesn't want to leave.

375
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,040
What a privilege, eh?

376
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,170
Next time:

377
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:58,620
A lioness battles against the odds...

378
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,660
..To protect her family.

379
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:14,540
Can she lead them back from the brink of disaster?
